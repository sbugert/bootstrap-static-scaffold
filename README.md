=========================

A perfect starting point for static website development!

1. Use `bower install` to download components.
2. Use `npm install` to install grunt tasks.


`grunt init` will copy jQuery and bootstap files to /src.

`grunt` runs your HTML through usemin, cssmin, uglify, rev and htmlmin.

You will find your production-ready files in /dist. Perfect.

Run `node server` and visit http://localhost:8080 for review!
